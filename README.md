# Image Segmentation Using U-Net

This project implements **image segmentation** using the **U-Net architecture**, leveraging **Google Colab** for training and evaluation. The dataset is directly loaded from Kaggle, making it easy to replicate and customize the workflow. It focuses on segmenting images by generating pixel-wise masks.

## Overview

Image segmentation is a process of dividing an image into multiple meaningful regions. This project uses **U-Net**, a convolutional neural network architecture widely used for segmentation tasks, especially in biomedical and environmental imaging.

The Colab notebook:
- Preprocesses input images and masks.
- Builds the U-Net model architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Trains the model on the Kaggle dataset.
- Evaluates and visualizes segmentation results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Augmented Forest Segmentation Dataset**, which is available on Kaggle:  
[Download the Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quadeer15sh/augmented-forest-segmentation).

In the Colab notebook:
- The dataset is directly downloaded and installed using Kaggleâ€™s API.
- Images and masks are resized to `128x128` pixels for uniformity.
- Masks are normalized and binarized for segmentation tasks.

**Note**: Ensure you have a Kaggle API token to access the dataset programmatically. Instructions are included in the Colab notebook.

## U-Net Architecture

The **U-Net** model has a symmetric encoder-decoder structure:
1. **Encoder**: Extracts spatial features using convolutional layers and max-pooling.
2. **Bottleneck**: Captures the most abstracted feature representations.
3. **Decoder**: Reconstructs segmentation maps using transposed convolutions and skip connections.

The notebook:
- Implements U-Net using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Provides flexibility to adjust input shape, filters, and output channels for different segmentation tasks.

## Colab Workflow

The Colab notebook is structured as follows:

### 1. Dataset Setup
- Automatically downloads the dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
- Processes the dataset by resizing images and masks to `128x128`.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Normalizes image pixel values to `[0, 1]`.  
- Converts masks to binary format for segmentation.

### 3. Model Definition
- Builds U-Net with TensorFlow/Keras.
- Employs skip connections for spatial detail retention.

### 4. Model Training
- Compiles the model using **Binary Crossentropy Loss** and **Adam Optimizer**.  
- Displays real-time loss and accuracy graphs during training.

### 5. Visualization
- Predicts segmentation masks for test images.
- Displays input images, true masks, and predicted masks side by side.
